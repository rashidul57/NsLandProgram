Instuctions about the repository
--------------------------------

This repository contains two folders as follows:
- DocMgmtApi: contains all backend code.
- DocMgmtUi: contains all frontend code.

As per the requirements I have used Visual 2022 for the development. I have chosen microservices architecture
for the development. So the backend and frontend codes running completely independently and they have separate
solution files so that they can be run from visual studio itself.

DocMgmtApi
----------
This folder contains two projects under one solution. 
- DocMgmtApi: Web api project containing all apis. 
- AppUnitTest: Project for unit tests of the web apis.
